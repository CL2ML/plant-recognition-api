# API to serve an image recognition model for the PLant Journey App with Flask 

## Specs

- The API is deployed on render.com (render is directly linked to git)
- The image recognition process is carried out on an individual server in order to separate the cloud resources (web app <-> web service)
- The Model data (.pkl file) is downloaded by the app from a cloud storage url while rendering in order to keep the app as lightweight as possible
